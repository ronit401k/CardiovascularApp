      <li> I analyzed the data available from the Framingham Heart Study. This was a landmark research project that began in 1948 and followed a large group of people who developed Cardiovascular heart diseases over time.
      Its main purpose was to identify common factors in patients in order to be able to calculate the “risk factors”.
      The researchers recruited 11,000+ men & women in a certain age range.
