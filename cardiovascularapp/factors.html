    <h1>Factors of Cardiovascular Disease</h1>
    <h3>Framingham Heart Study</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>A landmark research project that began in 1948 which followed a large group of people who developed Cardiovascular heart diseases over time.
    </li>
      <br>
      <li>Its main purpose was to identify common factors in patients in order to be able to calculate the "risk factors"</li>
      <br>
      <li>The researchers recruited 11,000+ men & women to in a certain age range to examine.</li>
      <br>
    </ol>
    <h3>Data Set</h3>
    <p>I studied several different factors from the data including:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Diagnosis (yes/no)</li>
      <br>
      <li>Cholesterol</li>
      <br>
      <li>Smoking Status</li>
      <br>
      <li>Age</li>
      <br>
      <li>Blood Pressure</li>
      <br>
      <li>Diabetic Status</li>
      <br>
      <li>Sex</li>
      <br>
      <li>BMI</li>
      <br>
      <li>Glucose Level</li>
      <br>
      <li>Family History</li>
      <br>
      <li>Race</li>
      <br>
      <li>Obesity</li>
      <br>
      <li>Tobacco Intake</li>
    </ol>
    <p>My main goal was to learn how the different factors impacted whether or not the patient was diagnosed with a cardiovascular disease.</p>
    <h3>Significant Factors</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Sex: A male patient is 16.2 percent more likely to have CHD</li>
      <br>
      <li>Diabetic Status: A patient with diabetes is 15.5 percent more likely to have CHD than a patient without</li>
      <br>
      <li>Systolic Blood Pressure: As blood pressure increases by 1, risk increases by 0.2 percent</li>
      <br>
      <li>Cholesterol: As cholesterol increases by 1, their risk increases by 0.1 percent</li>
      <br>
      <li>Age: As age increases by 1, the risk increases by  0.8 percent</li>
      <br>
    </ol>
    <h3>Analysis: The Significant Values</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>sex: 2e<sup>-16</sup></li>
      <li>diabetes: 6.03e<sup>-5</sup></li>
      <li>cholesterol: 0.0001</li>
      <li>age: 5.33e<sup>-12</sup></li>
      <li>blood pressure: 7.08e<sup>-6</sup></li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cannot change</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Age</li>
          <li>Sex</li>
          <li>Race</li>
          <li>Family History</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Can change</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Diabetic status</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Diabetes</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Type 2</li>
                    <ul><li>Makes it twice as likely for Cardiovascular Disease</li></ul>
                  </ul>
            </ul>
          <li>Cholesterol</li>
          <ul>
            <li>There are two types of cholesterol in the body. One is called Low-Density Lipoprotein and another is called High-Density Lipoprotein</li>
            <li>Foods that increase Low-Density Lipoprotein include the following: Burgers, French Fries, Pizza, Fried Chicken Sandwiches, Chips, Onion Rings, and processed meat like bacon</li>
            <li>Foods that increase High-Density Lipoprotein includes the following: Avocados, Salmon, Tuna, Olives, Nuts and Seeds, Oats, Fruits and Vegatables, and evenDark chocolate in moderation</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Blood Pressure</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Make time to exercise consistently</li>
              <li>For example, if you have 15 minutes to spare, do some pushups or squats. You can even do simple stretches to get the blood flowing</li>
              <li>It's also ideal follow a balanced diet like myPlate</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Diet</li>
            <ul>
              <li>If the majority of your diet includes high amounts of saturated fat and cholesterol, then the risk of CVD or atheroscherosis increases tremendously</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Tobacco Intake</li>
            <ul>
              <li>One of the strongest, if not, the strongest predictor of CVD</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Obesity</li>
            <ul>
              <li>If your BMI level is greater than 30, then it's higher than normal</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
